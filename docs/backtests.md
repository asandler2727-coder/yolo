# Backtest log

All runs: `.venv/bin/python scripts/rolling_backtest.py 2026-02 2026-07` at `--fee 0.004`
(Kraken taker). Gate: ≥5 trades/week AND positive total profit.

## Preliminary pipeline-validation run — 2026-07-19 — NOT GATE-VALID

Run while the historical download was still in progress, on the **13 pairs downloaded so
far** (alphabet-early: mostly illiquid small caps + AAVE/ADA/DOGE). Purpose was to prove
the harness end-to-end (freqtrade 2026.4 result schema matched; no code changes needed),
not to judge the strategy. This universe is heavily biased toward exactly the illiquid
junk the live VolumePairList ($250k/day floor) would never trade, so the loss numbers
below are expected to be much worse than the real universe.

Params: defaults (momentum_threshold 0.03, volume_mult 2.0, stoploss -0.06,
roi {0: 0.10, 120: 0.04, 360: 0.02}).

| Month | Trades | Profit % | Max DD % |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02 | 86 | -54.72 | 55.49 |
| 2026-03 | 90 | -61.99 | 62.47 |
| 2026-04 | 98 | -44.39 | 46.63 |
| 2026-05 | 60 | -16.23 | 26.23 |
| 2026-06 | 112 | -35.33 | 46.70 |
| 2026-07 | 43 | -13.22 | 13.95 |

Total: 489 trades, 18.76 trades/week, -225.88% summed monthly profit, gate **FAIL**
(profit leg; the trades/week leg passes with big margin).

## Real baseline, Feb–Mar 2026 full universe — 2026-07-19

Data: official Kraken bulk OHLCVT export (all pairs through 2026-03-31), 582 USD pairs on
disk; ranking + backtest windows both fully covered for Feb and Mar. Apr–Jul pending
download; when it lands it serves as out-of-sample validation for whatever Task 6 selects.
Params: defaults (as above). Run: `rolling_backtest.py 2026-02 2026-03`.

| Month | Trades | Profit % | Max DD % |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02 | 89 | -48.57 | 48.57 |
| 2026-03 | 90 | -25.66 | 25.79 |

Total: 179 trades, 20.6 trades/week, -74.23%, gate **FAIL** (profit leg; frequency leg
passes 4x over).

Open methodology question for the final gate run: the backtest does not currently apply
the strategy's protections (freqtrade needs `--enable-protections`); live, the 15%
MaxDrawdown halt would have stopped February long before -48%. Decide before the
go/no-go verdict whether the gate run should enable them for realism.

Takeaways for Task 6 tuning (to revisit on full data):
- Signal frequency is not the problem — 3.7x the 5/week floor even on 13 pairs.
- Losses concentrated in illiquid small caps; the real top-30-by-volume universe should
  behave differently. Do not tune anything against this run.
- Consider mirroring the live $250k/day volume floor in `rank_pairs_for_month` so backtest
  months can never include pairs the live pairlist would reject (harness currently takes
  top-N with no floor — only matters when few pairs have data).
